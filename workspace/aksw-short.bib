	abstract = {Modern data-driven frameworks often have to process large amounts of data periodically. Hence, they often operate under time or space constraints. This also holds for Linked Data-driven frameworks when processing RDF data, in particular, when they perform link discovery tasks. In this work, we present a novel approach for link discovery under constraints pertaining to the expected recall of a link discovery task. Given a link specification, the approach aims to find a subsumed link specification that achieves a lower run time than the input specification while abiding by a predefined constraint on the expected recall it has to achieve. Our approach, dubbed LIGER, combines downward refinement oper- ators with monotonicity assumptions to detect such specifications. We evaluate our approach on seven datasets. Our results suggest that the different implemen- tations of LIGER can detect subsumed specifications that abide by expected recall constraints efficiently, thus leading to significantly shorter overall run times than our baseline.

	abstract  = {With the growth in number and variety of RDF datasets comes an in- creasing need for both scalable and accurate solutions to support link discovery at instance level within and across these datasets. In contrast to ontology matching, most linking frameworks rely solely on string similarities to this end. The limited use of semantic similarities when linking instances is partly due to the current literature stating that they (1) do not improve the F-measure of instance linking approaches and (2) are impractical to use because they lack time efficiency. We revisit the combination of string and semantic similarities for linking instances. Contrary to the literature, our results suggest that this combination can improve the F-measure achieved by instance linking systems when the combination of the measures is performed by a machine learning approach. To achieve this in- sight, we had to address the scalability of semantic similarities. We hence present a framework for the rapid computation of semantic similarities based on edge counting. This runtime improvement allowed us to run an evaluation of 5 bench- mark datasets. Our results suggest that combining string and semantic similarities can improve the F-measure by up to 6% absolute.},

	abstract = {Link discovery plays a key role in the integration and use of data across RDF knowledge graphs. Active learning approaches are a common family of solutions to address the problem of learning how to compute links from users. So far, only active learning from perfect oracles has been considered in the literature. However, real oracles are often far from perfect (e.g., in crowdsourcing). We hence study the problem of learning how to compute links across knowledge graphs from noisy oracles, i.e., oracles that are not guaranteed to return correct classification results. We present a novel approach for link discovery based on a probabilistic model, with which we estimate the joint odds of the oracles’ guesses. We combine this approach with an iterative learning approach based on refinements. The resulting method, Ligon, is evaluated on 10 benchmark datasets. Our results suggest that Ligon configured with 10 iterations and 10 training examples per iteration achieves more than 95% of the F-measure achieved by state-of-the-art algorithms trained with a perfect oracle. Moreover, Ligon outperforms batch learning approaches devised to be trained with small amounts of training data by more than 40% F-measure on average.},

  Abstract                 = {Popular knowledge bases that provide SPARQL endpoints for the web are usually experiencing a high number of requests, which often results in low availability of their interfaces. A common approach to counter the availabfedility issue is to run a local mirror of the knowledge base. Running a SPARQL endpoint is currently a complex task which requires a lot of effort and technical support for domain experts who just want to use the SPARQL interface. With our approach of containerised knowledge base shipping we are introducing a simple to setup methodology for running a local mirror of an RDF knowledge base and SPARQL endpoint with interchangeable exploration components. The flexibility of the presented approach further helps maintaining the publication infrastructure for dataset projects. We are demonstrating and evaluating the presented methodology at the example of the dataset projects DBpedia, Catalogus Professorum Lipsiensium and S{\"a}chsisches Pfarrerbuch.},

  abstract  = {Scholars often need to search for matching, high-profile scientific events to publish their research results. Information about topical focus and quality of events is not made sufficiently explicit in the existing communication channels where events are announced. Therefore, scholars have to spend a lot of time on reading and assessing calls for papers but might still not find the right event. Additionally, events might be overlooked because of the large number of events announced every day. We introduce OpenResearch, a crowd sourcing platform that supports researchers in collecting, organizing, sharing and disseminating information about scientific events in a structured way. It enables quality-related queries over a multidisciplinary collection of events according to a broad range of criteria such as acceptance rate, sustainability of event series, and reputation of people and organizations. Events are represented in different views using map extensions, calendar and time-line visualizations. We have systematically evaluated the timeliness, usability and performance of OpenResearch.},

In this work, we propose a message passing based graph encoder - StarE capable of modeling such hyper-relational KGs. Unlike existing approaches, StarE can encode an arbitrary number of additional information (qualifiers) along with the main triple while keeping the semantic roles of qualifiers and triples intact. We also demonstrate that existing benchmarks for evaluating link prediction (LP) performance on hyper-relational KGs suffer from fundamental flaws and thus develop a new Wikidata-based dataset - WD50K. Our experiments demonstrate that StarE based LP model outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks. We also confirm that leveraging qualifiers is vital for link prediction with gains up to 25 MRR points compared to triple-based representations.",

So far, the most effective way to assess the quality of the dialogues produced by these systems is to use resource-intensive manual labor instead of automated means. In this work, we investigate whether language models (LM) based on transformer neural networks can indicate the quality of a conversation. In a general sense, language models are methods that learn to predict one or more words based on an already given context. Due to their unsupervised nature, they are candidates for efficient, automatic indication of dialogue quality. We demonstrate that human evaluators have a positive correlation between the output of the language models and scores. We also provide some insights into their behavior and inner-working in a conversational context.",

By representing the link specifications (LS) as interlocking blocks, our interface eases the manual creation of links for users who already know which LS they would like to execute. How- ever, most users do not know which LS suits their linking task best and therefore need help throughout this process. Hence, our interface provides wizards which allow the easy configuration of many link discovery machine learning algorithms, that does not require the user to enter a manual LS. We evaluate the usability of the interface by using the standard system usability scale questionnaire. Our over- all usability score of 76.5 suggests that the online interface is consistent, easy to use, and the various functions of the system are well integrated.},

	abstract = {Point of Interest (POI) data constitute the cornerstone of any application, service or product even remotely related to our physical surroundings. From navigation applications to social networks, tourism, and logistics, we use POI data to search, communicate, decide and plan our actions. POIs are semantically diverse and spatio-temporally evolving entities, having geographical, temporal and thematic relations. Currently, integrating POI data to increase their coverage, timeliness, accuracy and value is a resource-intensive and mostly manual process, with no specialized software available to address the specific challenges of this task. In this paper, we present an integrated toolkit for transforming, linking, fusing and enriching POI data, and extracting additional value from them. In particular, we demonstrate how Linked Data technologies can address the limitations, gaps and challenges of the current landscape in Big POI data integration. We have built a prototype application that enables users to define, manage and execute scalable POI data integration workflows built on top of state-of-the-art software for geospatial Linked Data. The application abstracts and hides away the underlying complexity, automates quality-assured integration, scales efficiently for world-scale integration tasks and lowers the entry barrier for end-users. Validated against real-world POI datasets in several application domains, our system has shown great potential to address the requirements and needs of cross-sector, cross-border and cross-lingual integration of Big POI data.},

Hence, providing explainable LS is the key

In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a generic approach that allows a LS to be verbalized, i.e., converted into understandable natural language. We propose a summarization approach to the verbalized LS based on the selectivity
	of the underlying LS. Our adequacy and fluency evaluations show that our approach can generate complete and easily understandable natural language descriptions even by lay users.},

  Abstract                 = {Link discovery is central to the integration and use of data across RDF knowledge bases. Geospatial information is increasingly represented according to the Linked Data principles. Resources within such datasets are described by means of vector geometry, where link discovery approaches have to deal with millions of point sets consisting of billions of points. In this paper, we study the effect of simplifying the resources? geometries on runtime and F-measure of link discovery approaches. In particular, we evaluate link discovery approaches for computing the point-set distances as well as the topological relations among RDF resources with geospatial representation. The results obtained on two different real datasets suggest that most geospatial link discovery approaches achieve up to 67� speedup using simplification, while the average loss in their F-measure is less than 15\%. Our implementation is open-source and available at http://github.com/dice-group/limes.},

(BVL). Our vision of the underlying data is an inter-commune data network, in order to support persons with special needs and, furthermore, to apply developments such as the Location Navigator to other municipalities. For this purpose, RDF will be used for the representation and linking of data in the future. Besides the presentation of the Location Navigator, we sketch some approaches we evaluated during the creation of the respective data model.},

We analyzed the most common errors encountered in Linked Data sources and classified them according to the extent to which they are likely to be amenable to a specific crowdsourcing approach. Based on this analysis, we implemented and compared two quality assessment methods for Linked Data that leverage the wisdom of the crowds in different ways: (i) a contest format targeting an expert crowd of researchers and Linked Data enthusiasts; and (ii) paid microtasks published on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We evaluated the two methods empirically in terms of their capacity to spot quality issues in DBpedia and investigated how the contributions of the two crowds could be optimally integrated into Linked Data curation processes. The results showed that the two styles of crowdsourcing are complementary, and that crowdsourcing-enabled quality assessment is a promising and affordable way to enhance the quality of Linked Data sets.},

It evolved from a static Web 1.0 to a multimodal and interactive communication and information space which is used to collaboratively contribute and discuss web resources, which is better known as Web 2.0. The evolution into a Semantic Web (Web 3.0) proceeds. One of its remarkable advantages is the decentralized and interlinked data composition. Hence, in contrast to its data distribution, workflows and technologies for decentralized collaborative contribution are missing. In this paper we propose the Structured Feedback protocol as an interactive addition to the Web of Data. It offers support for users to contribute to the evolution of web resources, by providing structured data artifacts as patches for web resources, as well as simple plain text comments. Based on this approach it enables crowd-supported quality assessment and web data cleansing processes in an ad-hoc fashion most web users are familiar with.},

In this network and its genesis, collaboration played and still plays a crucial role.
But currently we only have central collaboration solutions for RDF data, such as SPARQL endpoints and wiki systems, while decentralized solutions can enable applications for many more use-cases.
Inspired by a successful distributed source code management methodology in software engineering a framework to support distributed evolution is proposed.
The system is based on Git and provides distributed collaboration on RDF graphs.
This paper covers the formal expression of the evolution and consolidation of distributed datasets, the synchronization, as well as other supporting operations.},

An increasing amount of data is available as Linked Data which allows machines to “understand” the data, but RDF is not meant to be understood by humans.
With Jekyll RDF we present a method to close the gap between structured data and human accessible exploration interfaces by publishing RDF datasets as customizable static HTML sites.
It consists of an RDF resource mapping system to serve the resources under their respective IRI, a template mapping based on schema classes, and a markup language to define templates to render customized resource pages.
Using the template system, it is possible to create domain specific browsing interfaces for RDF data next to the Linked Data resources.
This enables content management and knowledge management systems to serve datasets in a highly customizable, low effort, and scalable way to be consumed by machines as well as humans.},

  abstract = {The World Wide Web and the Semantic Web are designed as a network of distributed services and datasets. The distributed character of the Web brings manifold collaborative possibilities to interchange data. The commonly adopted collaborative solutions for RDF data are centralized (e.g. SPARQL endpoints and wiki systems). But to support distributed collaboration, a system is needed, that supports divergence of datasets, brings the possibility to conflate diverged states, and allows distributed datasets to be synchronized. In this paper, we present Quit Store, it was inspired by and it builds upon the successful Git system. The approach is based on a formal expression of evolution and consolidation of distributed datasets. During the collaborative curation process, the system automatically versions the RDF dataset and tracks provenance information. It also provides support to branch, merge, and synchronize distributed RDF datasets. The merging process is guarded by specific merge strategies for RDF data. Finally, we use our reference implementation to show overall good performance and demonstrate the practical usability of the system.},

  Abstract                 = {Distributed actors working on a common RDF dataset regularly encounter the issue to compare the status of one graph with another or generally to synchronize copies of a dataset. A versioning system helps to synchronize the copies of a dataset, combined with a difference calculation system it is also possible to compare versions in a log and to determine, in which version a certain statement was introduced or removed. In this demo we present Quit Diff, a tool to compare versions of a Git versioned quad store, while it is also applicable to simple unversioned RDF datasets. We are following an approach to abstract from differences on a syntactical level to differences on the level of the RDF data model, while we leave further semantic interpretation on the schema and instance level to specialized applications. Quit Diff can generate patches in various output formats and can be directly integrated in the distributed version control system Git which provides a foundation for a comprehensive co-evolution work flow on RDF datasets.},

  Abstract                 = {Collaboration is one of the most important topics regarding the evolution of the World Wide Web and thus also for the Web of Data. In scenarios of distributed collaboration on datasets it is necessary to provide support for multiple different versions of datasets to exist simultaneously, while also providing support for merging diverged datasets. In this paper we present an approach that uses SPARQL 1.1 in combination with the version control system Git, that creates commits for all changes applied to an RDF dataset containing multiple named graphs. Further the operations provided by Git are used to distribute the commits among collaborators and merge diverged versions of the dataset. We show the advantages of (public) Git repositories for RDF datasets and how this represents a way to collaborate on RDF data and consume it. With SPARQL 1.1 and Git in combination, users are given several opportunities to participate in the evolution of RDF data.},

  Abstract                 = {The management and analysis of large-scale datasets -- described with the term Big Data -- involves the three classic dimensions volume, velocity and variety.
While the former two are well supported by a plethora of software components, the variety dimension is still rather neglected.
We present the BDE platform -- an easy-to-deploy, easy-to-use and adaptable (cluster-based and standalone) platform for the execution of big data components and tools like Hadoop, Spark, Flink.
The BDE platform was designed based upon the requirements gathered from the seven societal challenges put forward by the European Commission in the Horizon 2020 programme and targeted by the BigDataEurope pilots.
As a result, the BDE platform allows to perform a variety of Big Data flow tasks like message passing (Kafka, Flume), storage (Hive, Cassandra) or publishing (GeoTriples).
In order to facilitate the processing of heterogeneous data, a particular innovation of the platform is the semantic layer, which allows to directly process RDF data and to map and transform arbitrary data into RDF.},

It can be beneficial in various data and schema analysis tasks with applications in different standard machine learning scenarios, e.g. in the life sciences, as well as Semantic Web specific applications such as ontology learning and enrichment. Since its creation in 2007, it has become the main \{OWL\} and RDF-based software framework for supervised structured machine learning and includes several algorithm implementations, usage examples and has applications building on top of the framework. The article gives an overview of the framework with a focus on algorithms and use cases.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the last decade, we observed a steadily increasing amount of RDF datasets made available on the web of data. The decentralized nature of the web, however, makes it hard to identify all these datasets. Even more so, when downloadable data distributions are discovered, only insufficient metadata is available to describe the datasets properly, thus posing barriers on its usefulness and reuse. In this paper, we describe an attempt to exhaustively identify the whole linked open data cloud by harvesting metadata from multiple sources, providing insights about duplicated data and the general quality of the available metadata. This was only possible by using a probabilistic data structure called Bloom filter.
 Finally, we published a dump file containing metadata which can further be used to enrich existent datasets.},

The quality of provided information may vary as information providers have different levels of knowledge, different views of the world, and different intentions. Thus before information is used to accomplish a specific task, its quality should be assessed according to task-specific criteria. The goal of the thesis is to develop and evaluate a quality-driven information filtering framework which supports information consumers in their decision whether to accept or reject information. The main objective of the framework is to allow information consumers to apply a wide range of different subjective filtering policies. In order to facilitate the information consumers understanding of filtering decisions, the framework can generate explanations why information satisfies a specific policy. The framework is integrated into a web browser and is applied within a financial information integration scenario.}},

Unfortunately, for most of the languages the amount and quality of available lexicographical data is suboptimal, even though its availability is essential for all educational institutions and for the development of state-of-the-art language technology. In this paper we present a new source of lexicographical data for Xhosa, a language spoken by more than eight million speakers. For its utilisation in a multilingual and federated environment it is modelled using a dedicated OWL ontology for Bantu languages and possesses all features that are currently considered integral for the promotion of resource reuse as well as long-term usage. In the future, the introduced ontology may be used for other Bantu languages as well and may ease their combination to achieve more extensive, multilingual data stocks.},

  Abstract                 = {Precise information on spatial patterns of species richness and endemic species distribution is important for effective species conservation. In the Caucasus Ecoregion such information is virtually non-existent for invertebrate taxa. Using occurrence data from a large database we calculated species distribution models with the GARP algorithm for 471 spider species to visualize the diversity distribution of spider species in this region. Overall species diversity was highest in mountain forests of the North Caucasus, east-central Georgia, the southern slopes of the eastern Great Caucasus and south-east Azerbaijan. A regression tree analysis Chi squared automatic interaction detector method revealed the mean temperature of the driest quarter and precipitation parameters to be the main environmental factors shaping these patterns. Diversity of endemic species was correlated with overall species diversity but hotspots of endemic species (10+ percent of all species) exists in high-mountain areas, suggesting post-glacial speciation events in the high mountains as the main sources of high endemism in Caucasus. Further information on the spatial distribution of species diversity of invertebrate taxa in the Caucasus Ecoregion is needed to improve conservation efforts in this biodiversity hotspot.},

  Abstract                 = {Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation (NERD) systems have recently been widely researched to deal with the significant growth of the Web. NERD systems are crucial for several Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as summarization, understanding, and machine translation. However, there is no standard interface specification, i.e. these systems may vary significantly either for exporting their outputs or for processing the inputs. Thus, when a given company desires to implement more than one NERD system, the process is quite exhaustive and prone to failure. In addition, industrial solutions demand critical requirements, e.g., large-scale processing, completeness, versatility, and licenses. Commonly, these requirements impose a limitation, making good NERD models to be ignored by companies. This paper presents TANKER, a distributed architecture which aims to overcome scalability, reliability and failure tolerance limitations related to industrial needs by combining NERD systems. To this end, TANKER re-lies on a micro-services oriented architecture, which enables agile development and delivery of complex enterprise applications. In addition, TANKER provides a standardized API which makes possible to combine several NERD systems at once.},

  Abstract                 = {The challenge of developing information systems for rare diseases is in harmonizing social care conditions and health care conditions with the focus on personalization and patient autonomy. Knowledge about the most rare diseases is limited, which is the result of poorly funded research and the existence of only a few specialized experts. Furthermore, the treatment and care of the affected patients is very complex, cost-intensive, time critical, and involved stakeholders are very heterogeneous. The information needed by the patient depends on his or her personal situation and constitution. To support the information logistics between patients of rare diseases and (all) other stakeholders (e.g. physicians, therapists, and researchers), we developed an information system with Linked Open Data technologies in order to create a platform and tool independent solution addressing the heterogeneity of the stakeholders. To engineer system and data model requirements of our approach we analyzed the rare disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), which have wide-spreaded characteristics. The resulting formal knowledge representation was encoded in OWL, which allows, for instance, a modular development of complex areas and also the re-usage of existing knowledge bases.},

  Abstract                 = {Governments and public administrations started recently to publish large amounts of structured data on the Web, mostly in the form of tabular data such as CSV files or Excel sheets. Various tools and projects have been launched aiming at facilitating the lifting of tabular data to reach semantically structured and linked data. However, none of these tools supported a truly incremental, pay-as-you-go data publication and mapping strategy, which enables effort sharing between data owners, community experts and consumers. In this article, we present an approach for enabling the user-driven semantic mapping of large amounts tabular data. We devise a simple mapping language for tabular data, which is easy to understand even for casual users, but expressive enough to cover the vast majority of potential tabular mappings use cases. We outline a formal approach for mapping tabular data to RDF. Default mappings are automatically created and can be revised by the community using a semantic wiki. The mappings are executed using a sophisticated streaming RDB2RDF conversion. We report about the deployment of our approach at the Pan-European data portal PublicData.eu, where we transformed and enriched almost 10,000 datasets accounting for 7.3 billion triples.},

On the other hand, the Web of Science consists of high quality information created and reviewed by the international community of researchers. While it is a complicated process to switch from traditional publishing methods to methods, which enable data publishing in machine-readable formats, the situation can be improved by at least exposing metadata about the scientific publications in machine-readable format. In this paper we aim at metadata, hidden inside universities' internal databases, reports and other hard to discover sources. We extend the VIVO ontology and create the VIVO+ ontology. We define and describe a framework for automatic conversion of university data to RDF. We showcase the VIVO+ ontology and the framework using the example of the ITMO university.},

  Abstract                 = {The Web encompasses a significant amount of knowledge hidden in entity-attributes tables. Bridging the gap between these tables and the Web of Data thus has the potential to facilitate a large number of applications, including the augmentation of knowledge bases from tables, the search for related tables and the completion of tables using knowledge bases. Computing such bridges is impeded by the poor accuracy of automatic property mapping, the lack of approaches for the discovery of subject columns and the mere size of table corpora. In addition, tables on the Web most commonly do not contain any RDFa or other form of semantic annotation. We propose TAIPAN, a novel approach for recovering the semantics of tables. Our approach begins by identifying subject columns using a combination of structural and semantic features. It then maps binary relations inside a table to predicates from a given knowledge base. Therewith, our solution supports both the tasks of table expansion and knowledge base augmentation. We evaluate our approach on a table dataset generated from real RDF data and a manually curated version of the T2D gold standard. Our results suggest that we outperform the state of the art by up to 85\% F-measure.},

For any particular source and use (e.g. exploration, visualization, integration) of such information special applications have to be written. This limits the overall usability of the information provided and makes it diffcult to access information resources. These limitations can be overridden, if the information will be provided using a homogeneous data and access model complying with the Linked Data principles. In this paper we showcase how raw Open Government Data (OGD) from heterogeneous sources can be processed, converted, published and used on the Web of Linked Data.

This scenario leads to an extra coding-effort to achieve both the desired interoperability and a better provenance level as well as a more automatized environment for obtaining the generated results. Hence, when using ML libraries, it is a common task to re-design specific data models (schemata) and develop wrappers to manage the produced outputs. In this article, we discuss this gap focusing on the solution for the question: ``What is the cleanest and lowest-impact solution to achieve both higher interoperability and provenance metadata levels in the Integrated Development Environments (IDE) context and how to facilitate the inherent data querying task?''. We introduce a novel and low impact methodology specifically designed for code built in that context, combining semantic web concepts and reflection in order to minimize the gap for exporting ML metadata in a structured manner, allowing embedded code annotations that are, in run-time, converted in one of the state-of-the-art ML schemas for the Semantic Web: the MEX Vocabulary.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the last decades many machine learning experiments have been published, giving benefit to the scientific progress. In order to compare machine-learning experiment results with each other and collaborate positively, they need to be performed thoroughly on the same computing environment, using the same sample datasets and algorithm configurations. Besides this, practical experience shows that scientists and engineers tend to have large output data in their experiments, which is both difficult to analyze and archive properly without provenance metadata. However, the Linked Data community still misses a light-weight specification for interchanging machine-learning metadata over different architectures to achieve a higher level of interoperability. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting a novel vocabulary dubbed MEX. We show that MEX provides a prompt method to describe experiments with a special focus on data provenance and fulfills the requirements for a long-term maintenance.},

  Abstract                 = {Data is the new oil, this quote ascribed to Clive Humby most clearly describes the increasing impact of information on our society and economy. More and more data sets from various sources are published and used for different kinds of applications. Atmospheric reanalysis represents one of the richest and most valuable data sets for the open source community. However, transforming it into valuable information and linking it to other data sets is a challenge, especially for users from non-meteorological domains. In this presentation, we discuss the advantages of applying Linked (Open) Data principles to meteorological data in order to improve data acquisition for regional reanalysis (COSMO-REA2). By converting a COSMO-REA2 subset and linking it to further converted linked data, we illustrate how to gain much more knowledge using this approach. Different demonstrated scenarios, such as infrastructure planning for wind farming or transportation underline the advantage of this approach. Based on that, we argue that data in general and meteorological data in particular should be accessible by following the Linked Data paradigms.},

Although the data and the community created ontology have received immense investment, good tools to query and explore the data are still rare. In this paper, we present a prototype that attempts to break down complexity of graph querying into simple and guided steps. During the implementation of our DBpedia Explorer, we faced many barriers that can be traced back to a lack of data quality as well as the design of the DBpedia Ontology. We investigated these problems in detail based on a small sub-graph of DBpedia and gained valuable insights that will hopefully allow us to apply data trans- formation and ﬁxes to DBpedia that will be beneﬁcial for browsing and querying of the data in the future.},

In an RDF dataset it is possible to store metadata alongside the actual RDF data and several possible Metadata Representation Models (e.g. Singleton Property and n-ary relation) have been proposed. However, studies investigating the performance of these models show that choosing the appropriate metadata representation depends on the used data and metadata, queries and RDF store. To allow a flexible storage and querying of data and its metadata independent of the applied Metadata Representation Model, we propose MaSQue (Metadata Storage and Querying). The approach introduces an intermediate (meta)data serialization format and query annotations as metadata layer on top of RDF and SPARQL.},

We argue that classic SOA architectures may be well-suited for transaction processing, however more efficient technologies can be employed for enterprise data integration. In particular, the use of the Linked Data paradigm appears to be a very promising approach. In this article we explore challenges large enterprises are still facing with regard to data integration. We discuss Linked Data approaches in these areas and present some examples of successful applications of the Linked Data principles in that context.},

In this paper, we present a concept that allows for building value networks between business partners in a distributed manner. Companies are able to publish Linked Data which participants of the network can clone and subscribe to. Subscribers get notified as soon as new information becomes available. This provides a technical infrastructure for business communication acts such as supply chain communication or master data management. In addition to the conceptual analysis, we provide an implementation enabling companies to create such dynamic semantic value networks.},

  Abstract                 = {Coherent and consistent tracking of provenance data and in particular update history information is a crucial building block for any serious information system architecture. Version Control Systems can be a part of such an architecture enabling users to query and manipulate versioning information as well as content revisions. In this paper, we introduce an RDF versioning approach as a foundation for a full featured RDF Version Control System. We argue that such a system needs support for all concepts of the RDF specification including support for RDF datasets and blank nodes. Furthermore, we placed special emphasis on the protection against unperceived history manipulation by hashing the resulting patches. In addition to the conceptual analysis and an RDF vocabulary for representing versioning information, we present a mature implementation which captures versioning information for changes to arbitrary RDF datasets.},

  Abstract                 = {In the context of the European Digital Agenda governmental authorities as well as virtual communities (e.g. datahub.io) have published a large amount of open datasets. This is a fundamentally positive development, however one can observe that many different that both for the metadata and the data itself different vocabularies are in use. Furthermore, the established vocabularies are often augmented with portal specific metadata standards and published in different (local) languages. If Open Data are to be integrated and aggregated across portals, this entails a lot of effort. In this paper we present examples how the problems of interoperability and multilingualism could be addressed for key open data asset descriptors. We focus on the analysis of today's problems and ways to solve them.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the main tasks when creating and maintaining knowledge bases is to validate facts and provide sources for them in order to ensure correctness and traceability of the provided knowledge. So far, this task is often addressed by human curators in a three-step process: issuing appropriate keyword queries for the statement to check using standard search engines, retrieving potentially relevant documents and screening those documents for relevant content. The drawbacks of this process are manifold. Most importantly, it is very time-consuming as the experts have to carry out several search processes and must often read several documents.In this article, we present DeFacto (Deep Fact Validation) - an algorithm able to validate facts by finding trustworthy sources for them on the Web. DeFacto aims to provide an effective way of validating facts by supplying the user with relevant excerpts of web pages as well as useful additional information including a score for the confidence DeFacto has in the correctness of the input fact. To achieve this goal, DeFacto collects and combines evidence from web pages written in several languages. In addition, DeFacto provides support for facts with a temporal scope, i.e., it can estimate in which time frame a fact was valid. Given that the automatic evaluation of facts has not been paid much attention to so far, generic benchmarks for evaluating these frameworks were not previously available. We thus also present a generic evaluation framework for fact checking and make it publicly available.},

This diversity and heterogeneity often involve an increasing difficulty of becoming acquainted with Semantic Web technologies. In this work, we present the SPARQLTrainer approach for educating novices in semantic technologies in a playful way. With SPARQLTrainer educators can devise a SPARQL course by defining a number of exercises either generically or for a specific domain. Learners can complete courses by stepwise answering questions of increasing complexity. These questions usually require the learner to build a SPARQL query for querying a certain knowledge base and using certain SPARQL features. The SPARQL queries created by a learner are compared with example solutions given by the instructor. This comparison takes possible variations into account and gives specific feedback to the learner.},

  Abstract                 = {Most knowledge sources on the Data Web were extracted from structured or semi-structured data. Thus, they encompass solely a small fraction of the information available on the document-oriented Web. In this paper, we present BOA, an iterative bootstrapping strategy for extracting RDF from unstructured data. The idea behind BOA is to use the Data Web as background knowledge for the extraction of natural language patterns that represent predicates found on the Data Web. These patterns are used to extract instance knowledge from natural language text. This knowledge is finally fed back into the Data Web, therewith closing the loop. We evaluate our approach on two data sets using DBpedia as background knowledge. Our results show that we can extract several thousand new facts in one iteration with very high accuracy. Moreover, we provide the first repository of natural language representations of predicates found on the Data Web.},

  abstract = {The role of Question Answering is central to the fulfillmentof the Semantic Web. Recently, several approaches relying on artificial neural networks have been proposed to tackle the problem of question answering over knowledge graphs. Such techniques are however known to be data-hungry and the creation of training sets requires a substantial manual effort. We thus introduce DBNQA, a comprehensive dataset of 894,499 pairs of questions and SPARQL queries based on templates which are specifically designed on the DBpedia knowledge base. We show howthe method used to generate our dataset can be easily reused for other purposes. We report the successful adoption of DBNQA in an experimental phase and present  how it compares with existing question-answering corpora.},

However, for ordinary users, to access information available on this datasets, it is still a cumbersome and time-demanding task that requires the knowledge of description frameworks and the use of formal languages. We introduce the Neural SPARQL Machine (NSpM) Telegram Chatbot, a chatbot built on top the open-source Telegram platform that facilitates the natural language querying of RDF datasets through the NSpM architecture. We show the different APIs implemented by the proposed chatbot as well as the processing steps from a natural language query to its corresponding answer. Additionally, we demonstrate how to instantiate as well as how to query other RDF datasets.},

A significant amount of research has been undertaken to provide solutions to this problem with varying degrees of automation and user involvement. In this paper, we present a two-staged experiment for the creation of gold standards that act as benchmarks for several interlinking algorithms. In the first stage the gold standards are generated through manual validation process highlighting the role of users. Using the gold standards obtained from this stage, we assess the performance of human evaluators in addition to supervised interlinking algorithms. We evaluate our approach on several data interlinking tasks with respect to precision, recall and F-measure. Additionally we perform a qualitative analysis on the types of errors made by humans and machines.},

  Abstract                 = {We are currently observing a plethora of Natural Language Processing tools and services being made available. Each of the tools and services has its particular strengths and weaknesses, but exploiting the strengths and synergistically combining different tools is currently an extremely cumbersome and time consuming task. Also, once a particular set of tools is integrated, this integration is not reusable by others. We argue that simplifying the interoperability of different NLP tools performing similar but also complementary tasks will facilitate the comparability of results and the creation of sophisticated NLP applications. In this paper, we present the NLP Interchange Format (NIF). NIF is based on a Linked Data enabled URI scheme for identifying elements in (hyper-)texts and an ontology for describing common NLP terms and concepts. In contrast to more centralized solutions such as UIMA and GATE, NIF enables the creation of heterogeneous, distributed and loosely coupled NLP applications, which use the Web as an integration platform. We present several use cases of the second version of the NIF specification (NIF 2.0) and the result of a developer study.},

  Abstract                 = {Structured data is picking up on the Web, particularly in the search world. Schema.org, jointly initiated by Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo! provides a hierarchical set of vocabularies to embed metadata in HTML pages for an enhanced search and browsing experience. RDFa-Lite, Microdata and JSON-LD as lower semantic techniques have gained more attention by Web users to markup Web pages and even emails based on Schema.org. However, from the user interface point of view, we still lack user-friendly tools that facilitate the process of structured content authoring. The majority of information still is contained in and exchanged using unstructured documents, such as Web pages, text documents, images and videos. This can also not be expected to change, since text, images and videos are the natural way how humans interact with information. In this paper we present RDFaCE as an implementation of WYSIWYM (What-You-See-Is-What-You-Mean) concept for direct manipulation of semantically structured content in conventional modalities. RDFaCE utilizes on-the-fly form generation based on Schema.org vocabulary for embedding metadata within Web documents. Furthermore, it employs external NLP services to enable automatic annotation of entities and to suggest URIs for entities. RDFaCE is written as a plugin for TinyMCE WYSIWYG editor thereby can be easily integrated into existing content management systems.},
